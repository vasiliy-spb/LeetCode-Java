# Solution
## Overview

We are given a binary array nums and an integer goal. The task is to find the number of non-empty subarrays in the given binary array where the sum of elements in the subarray equals the specified goal.

Key Observations:

    * The array contains only binary values (0 or 1).
    * The goal is to find subarrays with a specific sum.
    * The subarrays should be non-empty and contiguous.

Consider the given example with nums = [1,0,1,0,1] and goal = 2:

Output: 4

Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]

Note that all these subarrays are contiguous parts of the given array, and the count of such subarrays is the output.

## Approach 1: Prefix Sum
### Intuition

The task involves identifying contiguous sequences of elements within an array whose sum equals a specific target value. Problems that require sequences of elements to meet criteria often utilize [prefix sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum).

We begin by iterating through the array. As we encounter each element, we maintain a running total (current sum). This current sum represents the cumulative addition of all elements encountered so far in the array.

Next, we check if the current sum precisely matches the target value. If it does, we have found a subarray whose elements add up to the goal.

Now consider a scenario where the current sum exceeds the target value. This doesn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of finding a subarray that meets the criteria. We need a method to determine the sum of subarrays that begin after the first index of the original array.

A prefix sum represents the cumulative sum of elements up to a specific point in the array. By subtracting the target value from the current sum, we obtain a new value, called as "prefix sum." If this value appears earlier in the array, it means a subarray starting later adds up to the target. In simpler terms, a subsequence of these elements adds up to the target sum value.

We can use a map to track the occurrences of prefix sums. If a prefix sum exists in the map, it indicates multiple groups that sum to the target. We update the map by adding the current sum. This ensures we can find any corresponding subarrays that leads to goal.

Refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the algorithm with the example input [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] and goal = 2.

### Algorithm

    1. Initialize the totalCount variable to keep track of the number of subarrays with the desired sum and the currentSum variable to keep track of the cumulative sum of elements encountered so far.
    2. Initialize a hash table, freq, to store the frequency of encountered prefix sums.
    3. Iterate through the array nums.
        * Add the current element to the currentSum to get the updated running total. If the updated currentSum is equal to the goal, it means a subarray with a sum equal to the goal has been found. Increment totalCount by 1.
        * Check if the freq map contains a prefix sum currentSum - goal. This currentSum - goal represents the prefix sum of a subarray that, when added to the current element num, could potentially form a subarray with a sum equal to goal.
        * If freq[currentSum - goal] is in the hash table, it means there exists a subarray with a prefix sum equal to currentSum - goal. In this case:
            * Add the frequency of currentSum - goal (the number of subarrays with that prefix sum) to totalCount. These subarrays, when combined with num, would also result in a subarray with a sum equal to goal.
        * Update the frequency map by incrementing the totalCount for the current sum.
    4. Return the totalCount variable.

### Implementation

Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int totalCount = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        // {prefix: number of occurrence}
        Map<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>(); // To store the frequency of prefix sums

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum == goal){
                totalCount++;
            }

            // Check if there is any prefix sum that can be subtracted from the current sum to get the desired goal
            if (freq.containsKey(currentSum - goal)){
                totalCount += freq.get(currentSum - goal);
            }

            freq.put(currentSum, freq.getOrDefault(currentSum, 0) + 1);
        }

        return totalCount;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let nnn be the length of the input array nums.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    We iterate through the array once to calculate the prefix sums and update the frequency map.

    Space complexity: O(n)

    We use an unordered map (freq) to store the frequency of prefix sums. In the worst case, all prefix sums can be distinct, resulting in nnn unique entries in the map. Therefore, the space required is proportional to the size of the input array.

## Approach 2: Sliding Window
### Intuition

For a more efficient approach, let's consider aspects of the problem: We must achieve a goal using subarrays. We can't pick elements individually. Problems with these qualities are often solved using the sliding window pattern.

In a standard sliding window approach, once the currentSum reaches the target goal, the typical strategy involves simply moving the left pointer of the window forward to potentially find more subarrays. However, this approach has a critical limitation when applied to binary arrays.

Including a zero element in the subarray won't change the sum. As a result, even if the currentSum reaches the goal initially, we might miss further subarrays that also meet the goal by simply shrinking the window as long as the sum remains equal to the goal. This is because the presence of zeros creates the possibility of combining them with elements encountered later to reach the target sum.

Thus subarrays exceeding the target sum are irrelevant to our objective. We only care about subarrays whose sum is either equal to the goal or less than the goal.

Leveraging this insight, we can directly track the number of subarrays with a sum at most equal to the goal.

After calculating the total count of subarrays with sums less than or equal to the goal using the functionslidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal), we need to isolate the subarrays that strictly meet the target goal.

This can be achieved by subtracting the total count of subarrays with sums less than the goal (slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal - 1)) from the total count obtained earlier. By subtracting the latter from the former, we remove the subarrays that don't reach the goal and are left with only the subarrays that have a sum exactly equal to the goal.

Refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the sliding window on slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal).

![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/2_6.png)

Now, refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the sliding window on slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal - 1).

![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_1.png)
![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_2.png)
![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_3.png)
![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_4.png)
![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_5.png)
![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_6.png)

![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/3_8.png)

Now, if we subtract the count from the second slideshow (slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal - 1)) from the count in the first slideshow (slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal)), which is 14 - 10, we get 4. Here, 4 represents the number of subarrays with a sum equal to the goal.

The reason for this is that atMost(2) includes all sets of windows whose total sum is equal to 0, 1, and 2, while atMost(1) comprises sets with sums of 0 and 1.

Now, see that the set atMost(2) contains the whole set of atMost(1). So, when we subtract them, we get the remainderâ€”subarrays that have a sum exactly equal to 2.

Refer to the below Venn diagram for a better understanding.

![](./src/main/java/matrix/workingPeoplesImitation/task_930_Binary_Subarrays_With_Sum/editorial/4.png)

### Algorithm

Define the helper function: slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal):

    1. Initializes variables start (representing the start index of the window), currentSum (representing the sum of elements in the current window), and totalCount (representing the total count of subarrays with a sum less than or equal to the goal) to 0.
    2. Iterate through the array using a sliding window where the end pointer iterates from 0 to the end of the nums array.
        * Within each iteration, add the current element (nums[end]) to currentSum.
        * Use a while loop to adjust the window from the left side (using the start pointer) as long as currentSum is greater than goal.
            * Subtract the element at the start index from currentSum.
            * Increment the start pointer to move the window one position to the right.
        * After adjusting the window, the subarray from start to end has a sum less than or equal to goal, so increment totalCount by the length of the current subarray (end - start + 1).
    3. After iterating through the entire nums array, return totalCount, which holds the total number of subarrays with a sum at most goal.

In the main function numSubarraysWithSum(nums, goal):

    1. Find the difference by calling slidingWindowAtMost twice, once with the original goal and another time with goal - 1.
    2. Return the difference between these two counts, the exact number of subarrays with a sum equal to goal.

### Implementation

Java

```Java
class Solution {
    // Helper function to count the number of subarrays with sum at most the given goal
    private int slidingWindowAtMost(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int start = 0, currentSum = 0, totalCount = 0;

        // Iterate through the array using a sliding window approach
        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            currentSum += nums[end];

            // Adjust the window by moving the start pointer to the right
            // until the sum becomes less than or equal to the goal
            while (start <= end && currentSum > goal) {
                currentSum -= nums[start++];
            }

            // Update the total count by adding the length of the current subarray
            totalCount += end - start + 1;
        }
        return totalCount;
    }

    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        return slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal) - slidingWindowAtMost(nums, goal - 1);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let nnn be the length of the nums array.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    The function slidingWindowAtMost uses two pointers, start and end to process the elements in the array. Although there is a nested loop, each pointer starts at 0 and gets incremented at most nnn times, so each pointer makes just 1 pass through the array. This means the time complexity of the function slidingWindowAtMost is O(n). We call slidingWindowAtMost twice, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n).

    Space complexity: O(1)

    The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables such as start, currentSum, and totalCount. The space required does not depend on the size of the input array.

## Approach 3: Sliding Window in One Pass
### Intuition

In the previous approach, we were finding the answer by calling the sliding window two times. However, we can optimize it to a single pass.

To do this, we track the number of zeros at the start of the current window. Each contiguous sequence of zeros at the start of the window can be considered separately when determining the total number of subarrays that sum up to the goal. That is, we need to increment the totalCount by 1 + prefix zeros. This is crucial because each subarray within the window, along with each combination of prefix zeros, contributes to the total count of subarrays that sum up to the goal.

Leading zeros in a window don't affect the sum, but they create opportunities for more subarrays to reach the target goal.

The remaining logic is the same as the previous sliding window approach. We iterate through the array nums using two pointers: start and end, representing the start and end indices of the current window.

If the sum of the current window exceeds the goal, we adjust the window by moving the start pointer forward until the sum is less than or equal to the goal. Along with adjusting the start pointer, we also need to update the prefix zeros count accordingly with the current window. If the start pointer is pointing to 0, we increment the prefix zero count; otherwise, if it's pointing to 1, we reset the prefix zero count to 0.

For example, consider a window represented by the array [0, 0, 1, 1]. In this window, there are 2 leading zeros. This means that the window can sum up to 2 in 2 + 1 = 3 ways.

Refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the sliding window in one pass:

### Algorithm

    1. Initialize variables start, prefixZeros, currentSum, and totalCount to 0.
    2. Iterate through the array using the end variable as the end index of the sliding window.
        * Add the current element to the currentSum.
        * Enter a while loop to shrink the window from the left side if the sum exceeds the goal or if the element at the start of the window is 0.
            * Inside the while loop, check if the element at the start of the window is 1. If it is, reset the prefixZeros count to 0. Otherwise, increment the prefixZeros count.
            * Then subtract the element at the start of the window from the currentSum and increment the start pointer to move the window.
        * If the currentSum is equal to the goal, increment the totalCount by 1 plus the prefixZeros count.
    3. Finally, return the totalCount.

### Implementation

Java

```Java
class Solution {
    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        int start = 0;
        int prefixZeros = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int totalCount = 0;

        // Loop through the array using end pointer
        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            // Add current element to the sum
            currentSum += nums[end];

            // Slide the window while condition is met
            while (start < end && (nums[start] == 0 || currentSum > goal)) {
                if (nums[start] == 1) {
                    prefixZeros = 0;
                } else {
                    prefixZeros++;
                }

                currentSum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }

            // Count subarrays when window sum matches the goal
            if (currentSum == goal) {
                totalCount += 1 + prefixZeros;
            }
        }

        return totalCount;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let nnn be the length of the nums array.

    Time complexity: O(n)

    The function iterates through the nums array once using a single for loop (end loop).

    Inside the loop, the while loop might contract the window, but the total number of iterations within this loop is still bounded by the number of elements in the array (n).

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the single iteration through the array, resulting in O(n).

    Space complexity: O(1)

    The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables such as start, currentSum, and totalCount. The space required does not depend on the size of the input array.
